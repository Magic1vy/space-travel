### What I learned

I have learned how to work with sliders in React, practiced adding items to a shopping cart, changing the quantity of items in the cart, and removing items from the cart. Additionally, I have practiced creating components in React, navigating between components using React Router and useNavigate, and using data files.


### Useful resources
